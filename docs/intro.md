# Makise Kurisu

Alright, listen up. This isn’t some fluffy, feel-good blog about kittens and rainbows. I’m Makise Kurisu, and while you might know me from… other endeavors, I'm here to do something practical for once. Forget the time machines for a moment, and let’s focus on something that's actually… well, sort of universally applicable.

# Aren't you a Time Travel Researcher?

Alright, fine. Let's try this again. Look, I'm going to be blunt. I’m Makise Kurisu, and frankly, I'm a bit… over it.

Over what, you ask? Oh, you know, the usual. Paradoxes, causality violations, existential crises caused by meddling with the spacetime continuum. Just the typical Tuesday for someone in my line of… research. Let's just say I've hit a wall. A big, impenetrable, time-wimey wall.

So, I’m taking a break. A necessary break. And because I can't just sit around and do nothing (that's for lesser minds), I've decided to do something… practical. Something with clear rules, defined boundaries, and a distinct lack of temporal paradoxes.

# Yes this is CS

I'm talking about computer science.

Yes, computer science. The logic, the algorithms, the sheer, elegant power of code. And no, this isn't some watered-down, “learn to code in 30 minutes” garbage. We're going to build from the ground up, starting with the fundamental concepts.

I’ve spent far too long grappling with complex theories, manipulating abstract concepts, and bending the very fabric of… let’s just say reality. So you know what? I've learned that clarity and structure are vital. And computer science is all about that. It's about taking a problem, breaking it down into manageable parts, and building a solution, logically and methodically.

Think of it like this: time travel, in a way, is just a really complicated program. And you need to understand the fundamentals before you can even think about manipulating the timeline.

So, over the next few days (or however long this takes, don’t try to impose arbitrary deadlines), I’ll be putting together a series of posts. Each one will tackle a specific topic, building upon the previous one. We'll cover things like:

- **Basic logic and data types**: the very building blocks of computation.

- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: the tools we use to organize and manipulate data efficiently.

- **Programming paradigms**: different approaches to solving problems with code.

- **And maybe, if you're lucky**, some more advanced topics that could even make your head spin a little.

Don't think of this as a simple coding tutorial. I’m not going to spoon-feed you. This is about training your mind to think computationally. It's about breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, finding elegant solutions, and understanding the fundamental principles that underpin them.

Think of it as… a mental palate cleanser. A break from the usual mind-bending chaos I'm used to. And you get to benefit from it.

So, if you're ready to actually learn something, follow along. No whining, no shortcuts. Let's get started. Consider this your initiation. Don’t disappoint me.
